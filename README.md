# David Blue’s WORLD FAMOUS Fast n’ Loose™ Siri Shortcuts for 𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚄𝙱𝚂

**All** of the Siri Shortcuts I’ve created or modified over the years and and thought worthy of sharing, prioritizing those which I have not shared on either my [RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co/user/blue) or [ShareShortcuts](https://shareshortcuts.com/u/blue/) profiles. You shouldn’t encounter share URLS from *any* Shortcuts or File Shariing services, here - I thought a commitment to generating fresh `icloud.com/shortcuts`  URLs exclusively for this project would be in its best interest - I haven’t exactly been dilligently keeping track of them throughout the history of Siri Shortcuts as they’ve been exclusively shared this way…

It’s been three years since I first discovered iPhone-bound personal automation in a late build from iOS 12’s *Public* Beta channel, having skipped pout on the entire cycle for the first release in a good while. I’d been more occupied than ever before with my failing attempt to move myself and *Extratone* to the West Coast, and my news consumption was more focused than ever on *media* instead of consumer technology. Somehow I missed not only the news of [Workflow’s acquisition by Apple](https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-acquires-workflow/,) the previous Spring, but its hasty, surprisingly [well-covered](https://www.macstories.net/stories/shortcuts-a-new-vision-for-siri-and-ios-automation/) (by *MacStories*, anyway) “adaptation” of most(?) of their application’s extensive GUI-based script builder into the Shortcuts app, associated with Apple’s voice assistant as an “end around for the problems with Siri,” [as suggested by Dieter Bohn](https://pca.st/episode/9d2ada21-dc11-41a4-b000-1aefcdd641ca?t=361.0) along with the lion’s share of greater tech media supposition...
